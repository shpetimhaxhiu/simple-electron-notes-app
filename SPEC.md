## Code Overview

The provided code consists of three files: `main-clean.js`, `renderer-clean.js`, and `preload-clean.js`. These files contain JavaScript code that is used in an Electron application to create a note-taking application.

The `main-clean.js` file is responsible for creating the main Electron window, handling window events, managing menu items, and interfacing with the NeDB database for storing notes.

The `renderer-clean.js` file is responsible for handling user interactions in the application's renderer process. It handles form submissions, note editing, note deletion, and displaying notes.

The `preload-clean.js` file is a preload script that is loaded into the application's renderer process. It assigns the `ipcRenderer` module of the Electron package to the global variable `ipcRenderer`, allowing the renderer process to communicate with the main process.

## `main-clean.js` Documentation

### Dependencies
- Electron (`app`, `BrowserWindow`, `globalShortcut`, `ipcMain`): Used for creating the main application window and handling IPC (Inter-Process Communication) events.
- Path: Used for handling and transforming file paths.
- NeDB (`Datastore`): A lightweight JavaScript database used for storing notes.

### Functions

#### `createWindow()`
- Creates a new browser window with specific options.
- The window options include width, height, webPreferences, resizable, frame, hasShadow, transparent, and backgroundColor.
- Sets up the window menu and DevTools.
- Loads the index.html file into the window.
- Sets an event listener for the window's close event.

### Events

#### `app.whenReady()`
- Triggered when Electron has finished initializing and is ready to create browser windows.
- Calls `createWindow()` to create the main window.

#### `app.on("activate")`
- Event listener for when the application is activated (e.g., clicked on in the dock/taskbar).
- If there is no existing window, creates a new main window by calling `createWindow()`.

#### `app.on("will-quit")`
- Event listener for when the application is about to quit.
- Unregisters all global shortcuts.

#### `app.on("window-all-closed")`
- Event listener for when all windows are closed.
- Calls `app.quit()` to quit the application if the platform is not macOS.

#### `ipcMain.on("add-note")`
- IPC event listener for adding a note.
- Inserts the note into the NeDB database and sends back the ID of the added note.

#### `ipcMain.on("edit-note")`
- IPC event listener for editing a note.
- Updates the note in the NeDB database and sends back the ID of the edited note.

#### `ipcMain.on("delete-note")`
- IPC event listener for deleting a note.
- Removes the note from the NeDB database and sends back the ID of the deleted note.

#### `ipcMain.on("get-notes")`
- IPC event listener for getting all notes.
- Retrieves all notes from the NeDB database, sorts them by date/time descending, and sends them back to the renderer process.

#### `ipcMain.on("get-note")`
- IPC event listener for getting a single note.
- Retrieves a note based on the provided ID from the NeDB database and sends it back to the renderer process.

## `renderer-clean.js` Documentation

### Dependencies
- Electron (`ipcRenderer`): Used for IPC (Inter-Process Communication) with the main process.

### Helper Functions

#### `getById(id)`
- Helper function that returns the DOM element with the provided ID.

#### `createElement(tagName)`
- Helper function that creates and returns a new HTML element with the provided tag name.

#### `clearInputs(ipcRenderer)`
- Helper function that clears all input fields, resets the form, and sends a message to the main process to retrieve all notes.

### Form Event Listeners

#### `document.getElementById("note").addEventListener("input")`
- Event listener for input events on the note input field.
- Removes the "is-invalid" class from the note input field when text is entered.

#### `document.getElementById("note-form").addEventListener("submit")`
- Event listener for form submission events.
- Prevents the default form submission behavior.
- Retrieves values from input fields and sends a message to the main process to add/edit a note based on the presence of an ID.

#### `document.getElementById("reset-button").addEventListener("click")`
- Event listener for the reset button click event.
- Calls the `clearInputs()` function, clears the hidden input field, resets button texts, and sends a message to the main process to retrieve all notes.

#### `document.getElementById("note-list").addEventListener("click")`
- Event listener for click events on the note list.
- Handles deletion of notes and retrieval of note details.

### IPC Event Listeners

#### `ipcRenderer.on("note-added")`
- IPC event listener for successful note addition.
- Calls the `clearInputs()` function to clear the input fields.

#### `ipcRenderer.on("note-edited")`
- IPC event listener for successful note editing.
- Calls the `clearInputs()` function to clear the input fields.

#### `ipcRenderer.on("note-deleted")`
- IPC event listener for successful note deletion.
- Calls the `clearInputs()` function to clear the input fields.

#### `ipcRenderer.on("note")`
- IPC event listener for receiving a single note.
- Populates the form fields with the note's data.
- Updates the submit and reset button texts.
- Sets the event listener for the form submission event to the `formSubmitHandler` function.

#### `ipcRenderer.on("notes")`
- IPC event listener for receiving multiple notes.
- Populates the note list with the received notes.

### Initialization and Messaging

#### `ipcRenderer.send("get-notes")`
- Sends a message to the main process to retrieve all notes.

#### `ipcRenderer.send("add-note")`
- Sends a message to the main process to add a new note.

#### `ipcRenderer.send("edit-note")`
- Sends a message to the main process to edit a note.

#### `ipcRenderer.send("delete-note")`
- Sends a message to the main process to delete a note.

### Dependencies
- Electron (`ipcRenderer`): Used for IPC (Inter-Process Communication) with the main process.

### Purpose
- Assigns the `ipcRenderer` module of the Electron package to the global variable `ipcRenderer`.
